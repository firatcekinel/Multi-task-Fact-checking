This study primarily focuses on designing a multi-task explainable misinformation detection model. To be more specific, a fact-checking model is trained on veracity prediction and text summarization tasks simultaneously. The generated summaries are derived from evidence documents, serve as justifications for the modelâ€™s veracity prediction.

You need to install the packages listed in "requirements.txt" file to execute the codes. We also presented single-task t5-based summarization and classification models for comparison.
